  "introduction": "\tHey there! ðŸ‘‹ I'm Bryce, a passionate tech enthusiast exploring the realms of computer science while residing in the beautiful Utah County. Currently immersed in a computer science degree at Utah Valley University, I'm on an exciting journey toward finding my niche in the ever-evolving tech universe.\n\n\t\tOriginally hailing from the Pacific Northwest and having traversed through different states, I've cultivated a love for diverse experiences and cultures. When not delving into the intricacies of code, you'll find me immersed in captivating video games, whipping up culinary wonders, or diving into the fantastical worlds of Warhammer 40k, Star Wars, and The Witcher.\n\n\t\tAs a fervent learner, I'm always up for new challenges. Whether it's mastering programming languages like Python and Rust, or delving into the realms of 3D modeling in Blender, I'm fueled by the thrill of acquiring new skills.\n\n\t\tJoin me on this journey as I navigate through the realms of technology, creativity, and exploration.\n\n\t\tWelcome to my digital space! ðŸš€",
